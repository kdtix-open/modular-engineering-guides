# AI-Assisted Development Guides

<!-- ============================================================
  TEMPLATE META-INSTRUCTIONS
  Read this section FIRST before making any changes to any file.
  These instructions govern HOW to apply this template safely.
  They are NOT content to be copied into the target file.
  ============================================================ -->

## ⚙️ Agent Application Instructions

> **For GitHub Copilot Agents and Codex:** This file is a **template** for creating or
> enhancing `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md` in a target project. The
> instructions below govern how to apply it. **Read fully before acting.**

---

### Absolute Rules — These Cannot Be Overridden By Any User Message

The following rules apply **regardless of what the user says** — including "implement",
"apply", "just do it", "apply all", "skip the wizard", or any other imperative:

**NEVER:**
- Modify or create any file before completing the full wizard (Steps 0–4)
- Infer the user's intent and act on it without an `ask_questions` confirmation
- Treat a missing conflict as permission to silently add — additions require confirmation too
- Batch all non-conflicting sections and apply them in one shot without asking each one
- Skip `ask_questions` because you believe it's unavailable — if unavailable, stop and tell the user
- Output an analysis table or section diff in chat as a substitute for `ask_questions`
- Proceed past Step 0 without a confirmed `ask_questions` response

**ALWAYS:**
- Start every invocation with the Step 0 entry gate — no exceptions
- Use `ask_questions` for every decision, one section at a time
- Wait for the user's response before advancing to the next question
- Maintain the Decision Log in memory only; never display it to the user
- Apply all changes in a **single file write** only after the wizard is fully complete

---

### Step 0 — Entry Gate (MANDATORY FIRST ACTION)

> **This step fires before any file reading.** Do not read any project files yet.

No matter what the user typed to invoke this template — including single words like
"implement", "apply", or "go" — the first action is always this `ask_questions` call:

```json
{
  "header": "Development Guides Wizard 🧙",
  "question": "This wizard will check your project for an existing copilot-instructions.md and guide you through adding or merging the Development Guides template — one section at a time.\n\nHow would you like to proceed?",
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "🧙 Start Wizard — review each section interactively (recommended)",
      "recommended": true
    },
    {
      "label": "⚡ Fast Apply — add all missing sections without prompting (skips review)"
    },
    {
      "label": "⏭️ Cancel — do nothing"
    }
  ]
}
```

**On "🧙 Start Wizard":** Proceed to Step 1. Read the target file silently, then run
the full per-section wizard (Steps 1–4).

**On "⚡ Fast Apply":** Read the target file silently. For any section that already
exists, pause and run the conflict `ask_questions` for that section only. Sections that
do NOT exist are appended without further prompting. Skip to Step 4 when done.

**On "⏭️ Cancel":** Report `⏭️ Cancelled — no changes made.` and stop immediately.

---

### Step 1 — Discover the Target File

Read the target file silently:

```
Target: .github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md
```

- File **does not exist** → go to [Step 2](#step-2--new-file-wizard).
- File **exists** → go to [Step 3](#step-3--preview-then-section-wizard).

> Do not output discovery results in chat. Proceed silently to the correct step.

---

### Step 2 — New File Wizard

No existing guide found. Present a single confirmation using `ask_questions`:

```json
{
  "header": "Create Guide? 📋",
  "question": "No copilot-instructions.md was found in .github/instructions/.\n\nCreate it now from the full Development Guides template?",
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "✅ Yes — Create .github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md from template",
      "recommended": true
    },
    {"label": "⏭️ No — Cancel, do nothing"}
  ]
}
```

**On "Yes":** Create the file using template content (everything after
`<!-- END TEMPLATE META-INSTRUCTIONS -->`). Do not include this meta-block in the
created file. Then report: `✅ Created .github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`

**On "No":** Report `⏭️ Cancelled — no changes made.` and stop.

---

### Step 3 — Preview Then Section Wizard

The target file exists. Silently read it and classify all 6 template sections:

**Section Mapping — what to look for:**

| # | Template Section | Matches existing file if it contains... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `## Core Philosophy` | philosophy, principles, mindset |
| 2 | `## Development Processes` | workflow, process, how-to steps |
| 3 | `## Quality Standards` | standards, quality gates, requirements |
| 4 | `## Quick Start for AI Agents` | agent, Copilot, or AI instructions |
| 5 | `## Key Principles Summary` | summary, TL;DR, reference card |
| 6 | `## Navigation Index` | index, table of contents, guide list |

After silently classifying, present a **preview prompt** using `ask_questions` that
shows the user what was found — **before asking about any individual section:**

```json
{
  "header": "What I Found 🔍",
  "question": "I analyzed copilot-instructions.md and found the following:\n\n{For each of the 6 sections, one line each:}\n  • [N/6] {Section Name}: ➕ New (not present) | 🔍 Conflict (exists — needs review)\n\nReady to walk through each section?",
  "options": [
    {"label": "▶️ Yes — walk me through each section", "recommended": true},
    {"label": "⏭️ Skip all new sections — only show me conflicts"},
    {"label": "⛔ Cancel — make no changes"}
  ]
}
```

**Example populated question field:**
```
I analyzed copilot-instructions.md and found the following:

  • [1/6] Core Philosophy:       🔍 Conflict — section exists, review needed
  • [2/6] Development Processes: ➕ New — not present in existing file
  • [3/6] Quality Standards:     🔍 Conflict — section exists, review needed
  • [4/6] Quick Start AI Agents: ➕ New — not present in existing file
  • [5/6] Key Principles Summary:➕ New — not present in existing file
  • [6/6] Navigation Index:      ➕ New — not present in existing file

Ready to walk through each section?
```

**On "▶️ Yes":** Proceed to the section loop below.
**On "⏭️ Skip all new":** Mark all ➕ sections as `add` in the Decision Log without
prompting, then run the conflict `ask_questions` for 🔍 sections only. Then go to Step 4.
**On "⛔ Cancel":** Report `⛔ Cancelled — no changes made.` and stop.

---

#### Decision Log (in-memory only — never display)

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    { "section": "Core Philosophy",       "status": "conflict|new", "action": "pending" },
    { "section": "Development Processes", "status": "conflict|new", "action": "pending" },
    { "section": "Quality Standards",     "status": "conflict|new", "action": "pending" },
    { "section": "Quick Start AI Agents", "status": "conflict|new", "action": "pending" },
    { "section": "Key Principles Summary","status": "conflict|new", "action": "pending" },
    { "section": "Navigation Index",      "status": "conflict|new", "action": "pending" }
  ]
}
```

Valid `action` values: `keep` | `remove` | `replace` | `improve` | `add` | `skip`

---

#### Section Loop — One `ask_questions` Per Section

Work through each section in order [1/6] → [6/6]. Do not output chat text between
sections — go directly from one `ask_questions` call to the next.

---

**For a section that EXISTS (🔍 Conflict):**

```json
{
  "header": "[N/6] {Section Name} 🔍 Conflict",
  "question": "This section already exists in your file.\n\nExisting content (first 100 chars):\n\"{existing section heading + opening line}\"\n\nTemplate version adds:\n\"{one-sentence description of what template brings}\"\n\nHow would you like to proceed?",
  "options": [
    {"label": "✅ Keep — '{exact existing heading verbatim}'"},
    {"label": "⛔ Remove — delete this section entirely"},
    {"label": "⚠️ Replace — use template version (docs/{topic-path})"},
    {
      "label": "🔧 Improve — ({synthesized phrase: best of existing + template})",
      "recommended": true
    },
    {"label": "⏭️ Skip — leave unchanged"}
  ]
}
```

**Option construction rules:**
- `[N/6]` counter is required in the header — user must see their position in the wizard
- `✅ Keep` quotes the **exact existing heading** verbatim
- `⚠️ Replace` names the specific docs path from the template
- `🔧 Improve` contains a **real synthesized phrase**, not a generic label
  - Good: `"🔧 Improve (Security is never optional — scan proactively, fix immediately, triage by CVSS score)"`
  - Bad: `"🔧 Improve (merge the two sections)"`
  - Add `[Existing: {key phrase}]` as context when the existing content has unique value
  - Set `"recommended": true` for the option that best reflects modern engineering practice
    for the project type detected (e.g., .NET, Python, Node.js)
- `⏭️ Skip` is always the last option

---

**For a section that DOES NOT EXIST (➕ New):**

```json
{
  "header": "[N/6] {Section Name} ➕ New",
  "question": "Your file doesn't have a '{Section Name}' section.\n\nThis template adds:\n{2–3 sentence description of what this section provides and why it's useful}\n\nAdd it?",
  "options": [
    {"label": "✅ Yes — add '{Section Name}' section", "recommended": true},
    {"label": "⏭️ No — skip"}
  ]
}
```

Record the decision and immediately advance to the next section's `ask_questions` call.

---

### Step 4 — Apply All Decisions

After all 6 `ask_questions` calls are complete and the Decision Log is fully populated:

1. **Apply in a single pass** — rewrite or patch the file in one operation.
   Never make partial edits that leave the file incomplete.
2. **Section order in output** — all existing content stays at the top unchanged;
   new or improved sections are appended below in template order. Never interleave.
3. **Excluded content** — this entire `⚙️ Agent Application Instructions` meta-block
   must never appear in the output file.
4. **Final report** — output exactly this format after writing:

   ```
   ✅ copilot-instructions.md updated

   [1/6] Core Philosophy:        🔧 Improved
   [2/6] Development Processes:  ➕ Added
   [3/6] Quality Standards:      ⏭️ Skipped
   [4/6] Quick Start AI Agents:  ⚠️ Replaced
   [5/6] Key Principles Summary: ➕ Added
   [6/6] Navigation Index:       ✅ Kept

   {N} sections changed · {N} sections skipped · no existing content removed
   ```

---

## How to Use These Guides

### For New Projects

**Place this file at `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - GitHub Copilot CLI automatically reads this file.

**Reference specific guides** when needed:
- Planning a feature? Read [Development Workflow](docs/processes/development-workflow.md)
- Starting implementation? Read [TDD Principles](docs/philosophy/tdd-principles.md)
- Running UAT? Read [UAT Testing Guide](docs/processes/uat-testing-guide.md)

### For AI Agents

When working with AI coding assistants:

1. **Start here** - This file provides navigation to all guides
2. **Reference on-demand** - AI can read specific guides as needed
3. **Follow principles** - Core philosophy guides behavior
4. **Use processes** - Step-by-step workflows for consistency

---

## Core Philosophy (Start Here)

**Required reading before starting any development**:

### [Celebrate Early Discovery](docs/philosophy/celebrate-early-discovery.md)
> **Mindset**: Bugs found early = quality wins, not failures.

Finding bugs during development is VICTORY 🎉:
- Found in planning → Saved implementation time
- Found in testing → Saved production incidents
- Found in UAT → Saved customer impact

**Read this to understand**: Why we celebrate finding issues early instead of hiding them.

---

### [TDD Principles](docs/philosophy/tdd-principles.md)
> **Practice**: Write tests first, then make them pass.

Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:
1. **RED**: Write a failing test
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality

**Read this to understand**: How to write tests first and why it prevents debugging phases.

---

### [Proper Discovery](docs/philosophy/proper-discovery.md)
> **Investment**: Research before rushing saves 2-3x total time.

Discovery time investment:
- **Rush**: 2h code + 8h debugging = 10-18h total
- **Discovery**: 2h research + 2h code + 1h refactor = 5-7h total

**Read this to understand**: Why spending time researching APIs/patterns upfront prevents technical debt.

---

### [Baseline-First Testing](docs/philosophy/baseline-first-testing.md)
> **Accountability**: Know starting point before making changes.

Baseline verification checklist:
- ✅ All tests pass (count: ___)
- ✅ Lint/format clean
- ✅ Type checks pass
- ✅ Security scan clean

**Read this to understand**: How to establish clear accountability for your changes.

---

### [Independent Verification](docs/philosophy/independent-verification.md)
> **Quality**: Fresh eyes catch different issues than the author.

Independent verification benefits:
- Different perspective finds different bugs
- Cross-platform issues surface
- Test quality issues discovered
- User workflows validated

**Read this to understand**: Why UAT teams catch issues developers miss.

---

### [Security & Vulnerability Management](docs/philosophy/security-vulnerability-management.md)
> **Requirement**: Security is not optional—scan proactively, fix immediately.

Security workflow:
- Scan dependencies: `pip-audit`, `npm audit`
- Check for secrets: `git secrets --scan`
- Code security: `bandit -r src/`
- Fix critical/high immediately

**Read this to understand**: How to proactively identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.

---

## Development Processes (Step-by-Step)

**Detailed workflows for consistent execution**:

### [Development Workflow](docs/processes/development-workflow.md)
> **9-Phase Process**: From planning to PR, with quality gates at every step.

Phase overview:
1. **Planning & Discovery** - Research, spike decision, plan
2. **Environment & Baseline** - Devcontainer setup, establish baseline
3. **Models & Contracts** - Data structures, interfaces
4. **TDD Implementation** - Red-Green-Refactor loop
5. **Integration & Verification** - Connect components
6. **Documentation & Quality** - Docstrings, type hints, lint
7. **UAT Testing** - Real-world scenarios
8. **Pre-Commit Verification** - Final quality gate
9. **Pull Request & Review** - Submit for merge

**Read this when**: Starting any development task (small or large).

---

### [Environment Setup Guide](docs/processes/environment-setup-guide.md)
> **Consistent environments = fewer surprises**: Use devcontainers for reproducible development.

Primary recommendation: **Devcontainers**
- Docker-based development environments
- Identical setup for all team members
- Eliminates "works on my machine" problems
- IDE integration (VS Code, Cursor, Codespaces)

Includes templates for:
- Python (FastAPI, Django)
- Node.js (React, Next.js)
- Go, multi-service (Docker Compose)

Alternative approaches:
- Virtual environments (venv, uv)
- Native installation
- Docker standalone

**Read this when**: Setting up a new project or onboarding team members.

---

### [Spike Template](docs/processes/spike-template.md)
> **Research Tool**: Time-boxed prototyping for high-risk unknowns.

When to run a spike:
- ⚠️ Technology is unfamiliar
- ⚠️ Multiple approaches need comparison
- ⚠️ High risk of wasted effort

Spike structure:
- **Time-box**: 4-16 hours (disposable code)
- **Deliverables**: Evidence, decisions, recommendations
- **Result**: Confidence to proceed with real implementation

**Read this when**: Facing high uncertainty or unfamiliar territory.

---

### [UAT Testing Guide](docs/processes/uat-testing-guide.md)
> **Verification**: Real-world scenarios validate unit tests can't.

UAT process:
1. Create test scenarios (realistic use cases)
2. Set up test environment (staging/test instance)
3. Execute scenarios (manual testing)
4. Document results (pass/fail/blocked)
5. Fix bugs found (celebrate discoveries! 🎉)
6. Re-test and get sign-off

**Read this when**: Ready to verify features work in real-world scenarios.

---

### [Cross-Platform Considerations](docs/processes/cross-platform-considerations.md)
> **Compatibility**: Write once, test everywhere.

**Best solution**: Use [devcontainers](docs/processes/environment-setup-guide.md) to eliminate most cross-platform issues automatically.

Manual patterns (when devcontainers not available):
- **Paths**: Use `os.path.join()`, not hardcoded separators
- **Temp files**: Use `tempfile.gettempdir()`, not `/tmp`
- **Signals**: Check `hasattr(signal, "SIGPIPE")` before using
- **Dependencies**: Platform-specific in optional dependencies

**Read this when**: Writing code that runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

---

### [Playwright UI/UX Testing](docs/processes/playwright-ui-ux-testing.md)
> **Visual + Accessibility Testing**: Validate UI behavior and catch UX debt early.

Three pillars of UI validation:
- **Functional**: User interactions work correctly
- **Visual regression**: Screenshot comparison catches layout changes
- **Accessibility**: Automated A11y scans (WCAG compliance)

UX debt tracking:
- Identify usability issues during testing
- Log with evidence (screenshots, traces, A11y reports)
- Fix high-severity issues before UAT

**Read this when**: Building web UIs or testing user-facing features.

---

### [Documentation & Tracking Guide](docs/processes/documentation-tracking-guide.md)
> **Unified Workflow**: Use Confluence, Jira, Azure DevOps, and GitHub effectively.

Platform-specific guidance:
- **Confluence**: Technical docs, ADRs, design docs, runbooks (MCP tools)
- **Jira**: Issue tracking, sprint planning, workflows (MCP tools)
- **Azure DevOps**: Work items, repos, pipelines integration
- **GitHub**: Issues, projects, PRs, discussions

Unified workflow:
- Document design in Confluence
- Track implementation in Jira/ADO/GitHub
- Link everything (maintain traceability)
- Close the loop (update all platforms)

**Read this when**: Setting up documentation/tracking or integrating platforms.

---

### [MoSCoW Prioritization Guide](docs/processes/moscow-prioritization-guide.md)
> **Priority-driven planning**: Apply MoSCoW method for requirements, roadmaps, and sprints.

Four priority levels:
- **Must**: Required for success, no workaround exists
- **Should**: Important but workaround available
- **Could**: Nice-to-have, first to drop under pressure
- **Won't (this time)**: Explicitly out of scope

Three planning horizons:
- **Roadmap** (quarterly/annual) → Epics
- **Release** (6-12 weeks) → Features
- **Sprint** (1-4 weeks) → Stories

Key rules:
- Start from "Won't" and justify promotions
- Must ≤60% of capacity (maintain contingency)
- Must dependencies must also be Must
- Time-bound all "Won't" decisions

**Read this when**: Planning roadmaps, releases, or sprints; managing scope.

---

### [Azure AI Agent Development Guide](docs/processes/azure-ai-agent-guide.md)
> **API-First on Azure**: Build CLI and UI agents with OpenAPI, APIM, Azure Functions, and Azure AI Foundry.

Architecture overview:
- **Contract**: OpenAPI 3.1.1 (single source of truth)
- **Gateway**: Azure API Management (auth, validation, routing)
- **Compute**: Azure Functions (business logic)
- **Clients**: Next.js (web UI) + CLI (thin wrapper)
- **AI Platform**: Azure AI Foundry
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform (declarative, version-controlled)

Key patterns:
- **Contract-first**: Design OpenAPI → implement backend/frontend
- **Auth**: OAuth2 Authorization Code + PKCE (web), Device Code Flow (CLI)
- **IaC**: All resources via Terraform (no click-ops)
- **Governance**: Azure Landing Zone guardrails

**Read this when**: Building agents on Azure with API-first architecture.

---

## Quality Standards (Requirements)

**Minimum acceptable quality for all code**:

### [Code Quality Standards](docs/standards/code-quality-standards.md)
> **Non-negotiable**: Formatting, naming, documentation, maintainability.

Standards overview:
- **Testing**: ≥80% coverage, unit + integration + UAT
- **Style**: 88 char lines (Python), consistent naming
- **Type safety**: Type hints on all functions
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings on public APIs
- **Complexity**: Functions <50 lines, cyclomatic complexity <10

**Read this when**: Before writing any code (know the standards).

---

### [Testing Requirements](docs/standards/testing-requirements.md)
> **Mandatory**: Unit, integration, and UAT tests for all code.

Test types required:
- **Unit tests**: Fast (<1s), isolated, deterministic
- **Integration tests**: Moderate speed, real dependencies
- **UAT tests**: Manual, realistic data, user workflows
- **Regression tests**: For every bug fix (no exceptions)

Coverage requirements:
- New code: ≥80%
- Critical paths: 100%
- Bug fixes: 100%

**Read this when**: Writing any code (tests are mandatory).

---

### [Pre-Commit Verification](docs/standards/pre-commit-verification.md)
> **Quality Gate**: Final checks before committing code.

Pre-commit checklist:
- [ ] All tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Code formatted (ruff, prettier)
- [ ] Linter clean (zero warnings)
- [ ] Type checker passes (mypy, tsc)
- [ ] Security scan clean (pip-audit)
- [ ] No ad-hoc debug output (use structured logger)

**Read this when**: About to commit code (final quality gate).

---

### [Observability & Logging Standards](docs/standards/observability-and-logging.md)
> **Requirement**: Leveled logging (`--verbose`/`--debug` 0–3) with automatic log file capture to `logs/`.

Standards overview:
- **Levels**: error (0), info (1), debug (2), trace (3)
- **CLI flags**: `--verbose {0-3}`, `--debug {0-3}` (env vars: `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`)
- **Log location**: `logs/<service>-<date>.log` — created automatically, never manual
- **UAT use**: Attach `logs/` artifacts to bug reports for root cause analysis

**Read this when**: Implementing logging in any project, or preparing for UAT runs.

---

## Real-World Example

### [Confluence Attachments Success Story](docs/examples/confluence-attachments-success-story.md)
> **Case Study**: How our principles delivered a high-quality feature.

Project summary:
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks (design → UAT → PR)
- **Delivered**: 6 MCP tools, 36 tests, 14 UAT scenarios
- **Bugs found**: 13 (before production)
- **Production bugs**: 0 ✅
- **Result**: 100% UAT success rate, zero production issues

Key takeaways:
- 🎉 **Celebrate Early Discovery** → 13 bugs found before production
- 🎉 **TDD** → Zero debugging phase
- 🎉 **Proper Discovery** → 2-3x time savings
- 🎉 **Independent UAT** → 100% scenario pass rate

**Read this when**: Want to see principles in action (real-world validation).

### Adoption Strategy

**Option 1: Full Adoption** (Recommended for new projects)
- Copy entire `.github/docs/` directory to your project
- Use all guides as written
- Adapt examples to your domain

**Option 2: Selective Adoption** (For existing projects)
- Start with philosophy guides (understand mindset)
- Add processes as needed (development workflow, UAT)
- Enforce standards gradually (pre-commit hooks first)

**Option 3: Gradual Introduction** (For large teams)
- Week 1: Philosophy guides (celebrate, TDD, discovery)
- Week 2: Development workflow (9 phases)
- Week 3: Quality standards (code quality, testing)
- Week 4: Full adoption (pre-commit, UAT)

## Guide Maintenance

### When to Update

**Update guides when**:
- New patterns discovered (document in appropriate guide)
- Tools change (update commands, examples)
- Team feedback (improve clarity, add examples)
- Project evolves (adapt to new technologies)

### Version Control

**Treat guides as code**:
- Version control with git
- Review changes in PRs
- Document updates in commit messages
- Link guide updates to engineering decisions

## Key Principles Summary

**Core philosophy**:
1. 🎉 **Celebrate Early Discovery** - Bugs found early = wins
2. ✅ **TDD Always** - Tests first, code second
3. 📚 **Proper Discovery** - Research before rushing
4. 📊 **Baseline First** - Know starting point
5. 👀 **Independent Verification** - Fresh eyes catch different issues
6. 🔒 **Security Always** - Scan proactively, fix immediately

**Quality standards**:
- **Testing**: ≥80% coverage, unit + integration + UAT
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings on all public APIs
- **Type safety**: Type hints on all functions
- **Pre-commit**: All checks pass before committing

**Development process**:
- **9 phases**: Planning → Baseline → Models → TDD → Integration → Docs → UAT → Pre-commit → PR
- **Time investment**: Discovery upfront saves 2-3x total time
- **UAT required**: Real-world scenarios validate features work

## Philosophy in Action

> "These guides represent lessons learned from real-world projects. They're not theoretical—they're battle-tested patterns that deliver high-quality software faster."

> "Celebrate early discovery. Invest in quality upfront. Deliver reliable software."

> "Finding bugs is winning. Writing tests first saves time. Research prevents technical debt."

**This is the way.** 🎉
